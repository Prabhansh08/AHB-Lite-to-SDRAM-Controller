# AHB-Lite-to-SDRAM-Controller
This project focuses on designing an AHB-Lite to SDRAM controller and verifying its functionality using the UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) framework. The controller bridges an AHB-Lite Bus with SDRAM, ensuring correct data storage and retrieval while adhering to SDRAM timing constraints.
