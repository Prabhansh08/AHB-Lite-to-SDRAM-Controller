# AHB-Lite-to-SDRAM-Controller
This project focuses on designing an AHB-Lite to SDRAM controller and verifying its functionality. The controller serves as a bridge between a master operating on the AHB-Lite bus and external SDRAM memory. Its primary role is to manage the translation of high-speed AHB-Lite bus transactions into compliant SDRAM operations. To ensure the functional correctness and robustness of the controller, a comprehensive verification environment is developed using Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), an industry-standard verification framework built on SystemVerilog.
